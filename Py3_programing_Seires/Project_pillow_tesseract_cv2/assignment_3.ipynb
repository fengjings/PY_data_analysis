Rick Snyder\\nwon reelection Tuesday, defeat-\\ning Democratic challenger Mark\\nSchauer ina closer-than-expect-\\ned campaign.\\n\\nWith most precincts in the\\nstate reporting, Snyder captured\\n51 percent of the vote compared\\nto Schauer’s 47 percent. In the\\nlast few days before the election,\\nSnyder and Schauer were close\\nin the polls with the Detroit Free\\nPress reporting a two-point lead\\nin Snyder’s favor on Oct. 29.\\n\\nIn his victory speech at the\\nRenaissance Center in Detroit\\nTuesday night, Snyder empha-\\nsized the economic trouble the\\nstate had long endured and his\\nefforts to fundamentally change\\nits course.\\n\\n“Our spirit was being broken,”\\n\\nGOT A NEWS TIP?\\nCall 734-418-4115 or e-mail\\n\\nnews@michigandaily.com and let us know.\\n\\nSnyder said. “It was not the time\\nto fix Michigan; that was not\\ngoing to be good enough. It was\\ntime to reinvent Michigan.”\\n\\nIn his speech, Snyder said\\nthere was plenty of evidence of\\nan economic turnaround. He\\npointed to the creation of nearly\\n300,000 private sector jobs, the\\nincrease in the value of Michi-\\ngan homes and the greater num-\\nber of college graduates taking\\njobs in the state as indicators of\\nsuccess.\\n\\nYet despite Snyder’s belief\\nin the success of his first term,\\nhe maintained there was much\\nwork to be done in the next four\\nyears.\\n\\n“When you have success like\\nthis what’s the next thing you\\nneed to do? It’s not to stay com-\\nplacent, it’s time to accelerate\\nand go even faster,” Snyder said.\\n\\nSnyder hinted at some of\\nhis goals for his second term,\\nlike filling tens of thousands of\\nskilled trade jobs, helping young\\npeople connect with education\\nopportunities and improving\\naccess to career technical edu-\\ncation, all of which he hopes will\\nlead to more well-paying middle\\nclass jobs.\\n\\nFour years after running on\\n\\nNEW ON MICHIGANDAILY.COM\\nThe Working Ethic: College ethics 101\\nMICHIGANDAILY.COM/BLOGS\\n\\na pledge to reinvent Michigan’s\\neconomy, Snyder was able to\\nsecure a second term largely\\non his fulfillment of that prom-\\nise. His supporters point to his\\nhands-on approach to Detroit’s\\nrecovery as a signature accom-\\nplishment of his first term. The\\nstate legislature, the city and its\\ncreditors and pensioners struck\\na Grand Bargain that allowed\\nthe city to move ahead with its\\nbankruptcy proceedings, which\\nwill wrap up this month.\\n\\nOn higher education, Snyder\\ncut state funding in 2011 with\\nthe promise to raise it again in\\nsubsequent years. He has incre-\\nmentally increased the funding\\nbut has yet to return it to the 2011\\nlevels. Consequently, Schauer\\nattempted to brand himself as\\nthe “education governor” in his\\ncampaign, calling for its funding\\nto be restored to pre-2011 levels\\nupon election to office.\\n\\nIn terms of the statewide\\neconomy, Snyder repealed the\\nMichigan Business Tax and\\nreplaced it with a flat tax to\\nappeal to new businesses, and\\neach of his last two budgets\\nhave resulted in a surplus.
